An On-Disk B+ Tree storage engine built as a part of reading [Database Internals](https://www.databass.dev/).
 Bubblegum is a toy project and an excuse to dive into and learn ideas from [badger](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger), [pebble](https://github.com/cockroachdb/pebble), [bolt/bbolt](https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt) and [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd).

- MVCC Concurrency/Lock Free
- SQL Parser
- Catalog
